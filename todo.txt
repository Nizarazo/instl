ConfigVars:

wtar:
    - avoid compression when wtarring zip files

    - unwtar stay out of sync folder not just bookkeeping
    - resolvesymlink stay out of sync folder not just bookkeeping

Cloud storage wish list:
    Be able to download whole folders???

installer:
    - checkout cxfreeze instead of pyinstaller
    - folder instead of single file. Is launching really faster?

error handling batch files:
    - unify batch as generated python? (Nir's idea) for better handling and reporting of errors?
    - PowerShell for windows? check if systems allow running unsigned scripts created on the fly

error handling python:
    - better handling and reporting of unknown command names, missing files, missing parameters, etc...

Admin:
    - convert all commands that use --limit to work with prepare_list_of_dirs_to_work_on

    - readthedocs
    - markdown

    - move SELECT(*)'s to be views

done:
    - handle UTF in parameters passed to instl
    - handle UTF for paths in !define and !index files
    - resolve implementation - state machine
    - unwtar join and untar in the same operation - saving multiple reads
    - unwtar commands for whole copied folders, not for individual wtars
    - ConfigVars: reduce the number of resolves, by caching values
    - unwtar: directly from sync folder
    - copy: add a 'remove_previous_version' field to index that will be done before pre_copy or pre_copy_to_folder
    - CloudFront! no more URLs file
    - wtar: remove .DS_Store before wtar
    - database: read views, triggers from file
