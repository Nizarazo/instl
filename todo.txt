Could storage wish list:
    Be able to avoid creating the urls on server - maybe use some time limited token?
    Be able to donload whole folders???

handle UTF in parameters passed to instl
handle UTF for paths in !define and !index files

checkout cxfreeze instead of pyinstaller

remove .DS_Store before wtar
