todo:

ConfigVars:
    - reduce the number of resolves, by caching values

wtar:
    - avoid compression when wtarring zip files

unwtar:
    - directly from sync folder

copy:
    - unwtar stay out of sync folder not just bookkeeping
    - resolvesymlink stay out of sync folder not just bookkeeping
    - add a 'remove_previous_version' field to index that will be done before pre_copy or pre_copy_to_folder

Cloud storage wish list:
    Be able to avoid creating the urls on server - maybe use some time limited token? CloudFront?
    Be able to download whole folders???

installer:
    - checkout cxfreeze instead of pyinstaller
    - folder instead of single file. Is launching really faster?

error handling:
    - better handling and reporting of unknown command names, missing files, missing parameters, etc...

Admin:
    - convert all commands that use --limit to work with prepare_list_of_dirs_to_work_on
    - remove .DS_Store before wtar

Put order in syncer classes: boto, p4, svn, url
    - decide which are not useful and remove them
    - unite the syncer classes and the instlInstance

documentation:
    - readthedocs
    - markdown

database:
    - get rid of sqlalchemy use plain sqlite
    - read schema, views, triggers from file
    - move SELECT(*)'s to be views

done:
    - handle UTF in parameters passed to instl
    - handle UTF for paths in !define and !index files
    - resolve implementation - state machine
    - unwtar join and untar in the same operation - saving multiple reads
    - unwtar commands for whole copied folders, not for individual wtars
