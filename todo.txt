- unwtar stay out of sync folder not just bookkeeping
- resolvesymlink stay out of sync folder not just bookkeeping
- why is WavesLib with 2 wtars?

Could storage wish list:
    Be able to avoid creating the urls on server - maybe use some time limited token?
    Be able to download whole folders???

handle UTF in parameters passed to instl
handle UTF for paths in !define and !index files

checkout cxfreeze instead of pyinstaller

better handling and reporting of unknown command names, missing files, missing parameters, etc...

convert all commands that use --limit to work with prepare_limit_list
remove .DS_Store before wtar

Put order in syncer classes: boto, p4, svn, url
    - decide which are not useful and remove them
    - unite the syncer classes and the instlInstance

rethink resolve definition, what to do with defaults, missing values, etc
resolve implementation - standard python resolve?
