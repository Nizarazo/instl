Move unwtar to copy stage:

1. Uncopied files must unwtar in place before taking any action. E.g. MS redistributables.
2. !file items that were wtared must be explicitly copied.
3. Resolve symlink files must be done in target folder after any unwtaring so symlinks would point to real files.
4. Unwtar on target folders.
5. Check that remove works OK.
