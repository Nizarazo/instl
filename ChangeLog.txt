23/1/2014 0.7.0 Shai Shasag <shai@waves.com>

     Main 0.7 features:
    * Check checksum of files after download.
    * Conditional document tags in yaml (see below)

    user visible changes, client:
    * Windows: wget gets --quite option
    * Windows: Running mkdir only if path does not exist
    * Removed the --state option, it was not working.
    * Removed the commands 'alias', 'shortcut' and 'fix_icon' , they were not used.
    * New help system: Usage: instl help command
    * Mac and Linux: "#!/usr/bin/env bash" instead of "#!/bin/sh" to be the shebang
    * Mac: Time measurement reporting in batch files
    * Checksum checking code
    * Windows: exit_if_error is added after most created batch file lines
    * All Mac & Linux rm commands generated by code were added the -f flags
    * Check for existance of file and it's checksum before issuing a sync command.
        Should be useful if sync was stopped half-way
    * Conditional document tags in yaml. Variable ACCEPTABLE_YAML_DOC_TAGS can specify additional doc tags that should start with index or define.
        Example:
            ACCEPTABLE_YAML_DOC_TAGS: define_$(TARGET_OS)
            Would later read sections starting with !define_Win - if Win is the target os.
    * Fixed bugs in interactive mode list command.
    * name of batch file is printed after it is written
    * variable TARGET_OS_SECOND_NAME defaults to os_second_name
    * Fixed list guid in interactive mode
    * Variable SEARCH_PATHS enables so set search paths in the yaml file.
    * improved reporting of bad checksum on windows.
    * Windows: robocopy might exit with error even if there are no errors. So error checking for robocopy is now level dependent.
    * resolve_defined_paths: SEARCH_PATHS, PATHS_TO_RESOLVE
    * sync message outputs the url for each file

    Changes to V9_test repository that do not effect code
    * 7ZA_CLIENT_PATH renamed WTAR_OPENER_TOOL_PATH, the 7 probably caused problems on windows
    * All Mac rm commands in index were added the -f flags
    * DOWNLOAD_TOOL_PATH moved to index.yaml
    * Mac:Setting of .framewoks to be bundles is now done by a new version of setIcon.
    * CURRENT_OS_NAMES renamed __CURRENT_OS_NAMES__

    user visible changes, admin:
    * New command stage2svn
    * Exception is thrown if unknown admin command is called
    * up_repo_rev now accepts only one option: --config_file, repo_rev file to upload is
        created on the fly.
    * Changed fix_props command to read information from config file.
    * trans command new option --base-repo-rev instead of --config-file that supplied the value before
    * createlinks will remove the up2s3 stamp file - if there is any
    * up2s4 will upload .txt versions of .yaml|info|props files in the instl folder
        so these files can be displayed in a browser.
    * ROOT_LINKS_FOLDER renamed ROOT_LINKS_FOLDER_REPO. ROOT_LINKS_FOLDER will point to the links folder above all repositories
    * repo_rev file is saved to "$(ROOT_LINKS_FOLDER)/admin"
    * Adjusted createlinks to work on local path urls
    
    programmer visible changes:

    * quoteme function is now quoteme_double and a new function is born: quoteme_single
    * Improved ConfigVarList.repr_for_yaml: added option not to write comments, add !define tag to document.
    * Reorganised instl command line parser
    * Data files (currently inst_help.yaml) can be accessed from instl when it's compiled.
        Using the new function get_data_folder()
    * Removed unused functions do_create_readlinks & do_resolve_readlinks as they are now
        incorporated into fix_symlinks.
    * Read/Write of info files can handle checksum field for files. All formats info/text/yaml
    * Fixed: --run option was required for trans command, although run is not relevant for this command.
    * Function renames: create_download_file_to_file_command -> download_url_to_file
                        create_download_from_config_file -> download_from_config_file
                        add_dl -> add_download_url
    * CopyTool classes and DownloadTool classes have platformHelper member,
        initialized in super, and so now all such classes have __init__ methods
    * ConfigVarList.is_resolved checks is a string has no $() references
    * Added data folder to search paths, removed the instl executable which was not usefull since it's a file.
    * file read for checksum using "rb" for Windows' sake.
    * download_from_file_or_url writes with "wb" for windows' sake.
    * option to redirect robocopy log to instl log - currently only from code not for variables.

9/1/2014 0.6.5  Shai Shasag <shai@waves.com>

    user visible changes, client:
    * Windows: improved batch file creation: @echo off
    * create_variables_assignment now always writes all internal variables, even in debug mode.
    * Output files on Linux and Mac get "set -e" so the fail if any sub-commands fails.

    user visible changes, admin:
    * added fix_symlinks command to replace symlinks with .symlink files. Worls only on Mac.
    * changed behaviour of create_links and up2s3 to be responsible for the whole links folder
        and to figure out want needs to be copied and what needs to be uploaded.
        --revision command line option is not available any more.
    * added fix_props command to add/remove inappropriate properties in the svn repository.
    * stamp file for createlinks and up2s3 will contain the base_repo_rev.
        So if repo_rev changes, new links will be created and uploaded.

    programmer visible changes:
    * Variable ROOT_VERSION_NAME changed to REPO_NAME
    * fixed: ConstConfigVar cannot refer to an inherited member that begin with __.
        So the getter function is called instead.
    * platformSpecificHelper rmdir method accepts new parameter 'recursive'
        when True enables the deletion of non-empty directories.
    * SVNTopItem new method min_max_rev, returns the minimal and maximal last_rev
        of it's sub-items.
    * CONFIG_FILE renamed __CONFIG_FILE__ because it's an internal variable.
    * __CONFIG_FILE__ is resolved and value assigned to __CONFIG_FILE_PATH__.
    * Config file is read once for all commands.
    * added props member to SVNItem to hold properties that are not executable or special (symlink)
    * Rearranged instlAdmin.py to deduce the name of the method to run from the command name
        ("fix_symlinks" -> do_fix_symlinks()))
    * fixed typos and redundant lines in progress report.     user visible changes:

2/1/2014 0.6.4  Shai Shasag <shai@waves.com>
    user visible changes:
    * instl version command works.
    * produced files get remark with the version of instl that created them.
    * sync one_by_one produces meaningfull progress report.
    * Windows: can download files with spaces in their name, such as "WaveShell-DAE 9.2.dpm".

    programmer visible changes:
    * Windows: urls need to escape spaces as %20, but windows batch files already
        escape '%' characters so use urllib.quote to escape spaces and then change
        %20 to %%20.

2/1/2014 0.6.3  Shai Shasag <shai@waves.com>
    * recompiled 0.6.3 for windows because the file instMisc.py was missing from previous
        compilation.

    * new instl commands:
