    * fixed wrong parameter name on CopyTool_win_xcopy.copy_dir_files_to_dir
    * Moved the curl config folder to be created in the bookkeeping folder so curls files for two version
        will not step on each other.
    * Better ConnectionHTTP.translate_url acts only on the path part.
    * DownloadToolBase.add_download_url in InstlInstanceSync_url.create_download_instructions_for_item: translate_url applied only to URLs created by instl.
    * Reading of info map file checks only checksum not sig.
    * Case insensitive checksum checks.
    * Checks with multi regexes are combined with new function compile_regex_list_ORed, used in conjuction with followingparams:
        FOLDER_WTAR_REGEX, FILE_WTAR_REGEX, FOLDER_EXCLUDE_REGEX, FILE_EXCLUDE_REGEX.
    * Fixed some errors discovered by Landscape.io
    * New function PlatformSpecificHelperBase.unwtar_something for unwtarring a specific item not just the current directory.
        PlatformSpecificHelperBase.unwtar_current_folder is now implemented by calling PlatformSpecificHelperBase.unwtar_something(".")

    user visible changes, client:
    * check-checksum command was defined by mistake to require --out command line option. Now removed.
    * A hack to prevent unwtaring of the sync folder. Copy command might copy something to the top level of the sync folder.
        So sync folder is avoided by detecting the bookkeeping folder inside.
    * If LOCAL_SYNC_DIR is not known it is extracted from SYNC_BASE_URL only if SYNC_BASE_URL exists.
        Previously if SYNC_BASE_URL was not found an exception was raised. Help to create remove without needing URLs.
    * Fixed the unwtar for non-copied object so that only what's needed will be unwtarred, not the whole sync folder.

    * GUIDs that have upper case characters are converted to lower case.
    * HAVE_INFO_MAP_PATH file is copied to the SITE_HAVE_INFO_MAP_PATH for possible usage by remove command.
    * SITE SITE_HAVE_INFO_MAP_PATH is used by remove if HAVE_INFO_MAP_PATH was not found. This was done because when removing installation that was done from offline folder, Central will not pass LOCAL_REPO_SYNC_DIR to instl. HAVE_INFO_MAP_PATH depends on LOCAL_REPO_SYNC_DIR.
    * New variable HAVE_INFO_MAP_FILE_NAME, used by HAVE_INFO_MAP_PATH, NEW_HAVE_INFO_MAP_PATH, SITE_HAVE_INFO_MAP_PATH.
    * Added time measurements to create urls
    * Sync command: When no files to sync created batch file will have one progress item: "Done Sync".
    * Sync command: When no dirs to create no prgress items will be created.

    user visible changes, admin:
    * Admin variable MAX_FILE_SIZE renamed MIN_FILE_SIZE_TO_WTAR.
    * New admin variable: WTAR_BY_FILE_SIZE_EXCLUDE_REGEX. Files names passing this regex will not be wtarred. This was done mainly to disable wtarring of instl itself when updating it.
    * Variable WTAR_REGEX split in to twp: FOLDER_WTAR_REGEX, FILE_WTAR_REGEX to allow separation between files and folders when choosing what to wtar.
    * repo rev file has new variable INDEX_URL_RELATIVE_PATH, for the convenience of the secure URL creating code.
    * improved the help for unwtar command
    * New command read-yaml, just reads a yaml file, can be used to check file's syntax and structure. (admin)

    * Interactive mode read command: added resolve_index_inheritance so proper dependencies can be shown.
    * Interactive mode depend command: removed duplicate items from report.
    * New admin command: depend. Output the full list of dependencies for an index.
    * depend command: added --out option, add help topic.
    * added depend command to gui/admin tab.
    * added --limit option to wtar command so it can work on specific folders.
    * fix-symlinks command will work even if there are broken symlinks. THere might point to inside folders that were wtared.
    * trans command: new parameter --base-url. If supplied will add url to all SVNItems representing a file.

    programmer visible changes:
    * Separated instlClient to different files by command: insltClientCopy, instlClientRemove, instlClientSync, instlClientUninstall.

        Copy might be called after the sync batch file was created but before it was executed.
        HAVE_INFO_MAP_PATH is only created when the sync batch file is executed.

    programmer visible changes:
    * BatchAccumulator new sections: begin happens after pre & assign and before links

    * ConfigVarList.resolve, when joining values will not join None values.

    user visible changes, admin:
    * When taring bzip2 is used instead of zip (--use-compress-program bzip2 instead of -z). Using zip
        created a different tar file every time something was re-tarred. This caused redundant uploads
        SVN and S3 of files that were not really different.
    * In GUI mode /Admin added indication to SVN repo and S3 bucket.
    * Fixed misleading messages in up-repo-rev
    * For GUI mode: reset SearchPath before loading admin config file, so that __include__'s will not be found in old search paths.
    * For GUI mode: SVN URL will be displayed with REPO_REV

        for example, creations of folders named "$(COMPANY_NAME)".
    * Shorten some variable names,

    gui mode changes:
    * Client input file is now a combo box that lets you choose files from the folder of the current choses input file.

    * New methods: ConfigVarList.unresolved_var &  ConfigVarList.unresolved_var_to_list.
    * ConfigVarStack.repr_for_yaml new parameter resolve, so we can write var list to yaml without resolving. Default is resolve=True.
    * copy_dir_contents_to_dir has new option preserve_dest_files=True.
        If explicitly set to False copy_dir_contents_to_dir will try to remove target files that are not in source.
        Does not work for xcopy tool on Windows.
    * writeAsYaml will no write None values as '~' and empty strings as '""'
    * implemented requirement_of field in InstallItem
    * iids_from_guid check if input is guid and return the original iid if not.
        This will save checking by claaer of iids_from_guid.

5/11/2014 0.9.18.6

    user visible changes, client:
    * New optional variable INSTL_MINIMAL_VERSION will be compared to current instl version,

    user visible changes, client:
    * Main feature: support for Windows XP.
    * Fixed: COPY_TOOL set to xcopy was ignored (WinXP).
    * Solved weird problems with xcopy. The /EXCLUDE option of xcopy cannot except a file with space it's path,
        nor will it except a quoted path. So the excludes file is copied to each and every target folder
        during the copy stage.
    * Fixed: when compiled raised exceptions would not cause exit code > 0 (Windows).
    * Fixed: Redundant messages when checksum fails.
    * Shorter max time for curl since now no file is > 5MB.

    * Changes to variable names:
         LOCAL_SYNC_DIR now always refers to the to top level sync dirs - above repo sync dir.
         LOCAL_REPO_SYNC_DIR - new - defaults to $(LOCAL_SYNC_DIR)/$(REPO_NAME), e.g. /Users/shai/Library/Caches/Waves Audio/instl/instl.waves.com/V9_test
         SOURCE_PREFIX - new - defaults to $(TARGET_OS)
         LOCAL_BOOKKEEPING_PATH - renamed LOCAL_REPO_BOOKKEEPING_DIR
         REPO_REV_LOCAL_BOOKKEEPING_PATH - renamed LOCAL_REPO_REV_BOOKKEEPING_DIR
         LOCAL_REPO_SOURCES_DIR - removed - use $(LOCAL_REPO_SYNC_DIR)/$(SOURCE_PREFIX) instead
         SYNC_TRAGET_OS_URL - removed - replaced by $(SYNC_BASE_URL)/$(TARGET_OS)
    * Due to variable changed method InstlClient.init_copy_vars is empty now.

        consecutive progress reports. Defaults to 0.
    * After creating a batch file, the full path to file is printed and the number of progress items.
        This number can be passed to the next invocation of instl as LAST_PROGRESS variable.

        the batch file to track progress even in the absent of absolute numbers.
    * New include style:
        url: $(INDEX_URL)

    * New yaml doc type !define_const - will create const variables and will not except __include__'s.
    * curl config files and file with list of curl commands are written to a folder named "curl".
        This will avoid clutter in the sync folder and make deleting easier.
    * No more DL_INSTRUCTIONS_TYPE, always use config file. To do non parallel download set PARALLEL_SYNC: 1.
    * Variables ending with _PATH or _DIR will have their value go through os.path.normpath - for proper paths on Windows.

    * New BatchAccumulator function __len__, returns the total assignments and instrauction lines.
    * parallel_run.py: plain exit() did not work in compiled code, replaced with sys.exit().
    * got rid of redundant __ALLOWED_COMMANDS__ variable and checking.

    * download_from_file_or_url writes with "wb" for windows' sake.
    * option to redirect robocopy log to instl log - currently only from code not for variables.

    user visible changes, client:
    * Windows: improved batch file creation: @echo off
    * create_variables_assignment now always writes all internal variables, even in debug mode.
    * Output files on Linux and Mac get "set -e" so the fail if any sub-commands fails.

    user visible changes, admin:
    * added fix_symlinks command to replace symlinks with .symlink files. Worls only on Mac.
    * changed behaviour of create_links and up2s3 to be responsible for the whole links folder
        and to figure out want needs to be copied and what needs to be uploaded.
        --revision command line option is not available any more.
    * added fix_props command to add/remove inappropriate properties in the svn repository.
    * stamp file for createlinks and up2s3 will contain the base_repo_rev.
        So if repo_rev changes, new links will be created and uploaded.

    programmer visible changes:
    * Variable ROOT_VERSION_NAME changed to REPO_NAME
    * fixed: ConstConfigVar cannot refer to an inherited member that begin with __.
        So the getter function is called instead.
    * platformSpecificHelper rmdir method accepts new parameter 'recursive'
        when True enables the deletion of non-empty directories.
    * SVNTopItem new method min_max_rev, returns the minimal and maximal last_rev
        of it's sub-items.
    * CONFIG_FILE renamed __CONFIG_FILE__ because it's an internal variable.
    * __CONFIG_FILE__ is resolved and value assigned to __CONFIG_FILE_PATH__.
    * Config file is read once for all commands.
    * added props member to SVNItem to hold properties that are not executable or special (symlink)
    * Rearranged instlAdmin.py to deduce the name of the method to run from the command name
        ("fix_symlinks" -> do_fix_symlinks()))
    * fixed typos and redundant lines in progress report.     user visible changes:

2/1/2014 0.6.4  Shai Shasag <shai@waves.com>
    user visible changes:
    * instl version command works.
    * produced files get remark with the version of instl that created them.
    * sync one_by_one produces meaningfull progress report.
    * Windows: can download files with spaces in their name, such as "WaveShell-DAE 9.2.dpm".

    programmer visible changes:
    * Windows: urls need to escape spaces as %20, but windows batch files already
        escape '%' characters so use urllib.quote to escape spaces and then change
        %20 to %%20.

2/1/2014 0.6.3  Shai Shasag <shai@waves.com>
    * recompiled 0.6.3 for windows because the file instMisc.py was missing from previous
        compilation.

1/1/2014 0.6.3  Shai Shasag <shai@waves.com>
    user visible changes:
    * Printing exceptions with traceback and returning proper exit code in case of failure
    * Renamed GET_URL_CLIENT_PATH to DOWNLOAD_TOOL_PATH
    * Removed unecessary indentation in svn output files
    * Fixed get_install_instructions_prefix for Mac - #!/bin/sh returned first
    * No resolving of readlink files. Temporary until we fiind a coherent method of handling symlinks
    * produced batch files on windows return to the orignal starting dir

    programmer visible changes:
    * Raising exception if REPRO_TYPE is not defined for sync command
    * Raising exceptions in instl.main (handled and unhandled)
    * DOWNLOAD_TOOL_PATH used as variable in download tools
    * Added return_original_if_not_found to instlInstance.search_paths_helper.find_file_with_search_paths
    * import urllib in platformSpecificHelper_Win
    * Normalized paths for windows, so they always have \. Since some DOS commands cannot handle /

2013-12-30 0.6.2  Shai Shasag <shai@waves.com>
    user visible changes:
    * curl DL_INSTRUCTIONS_TYPE: either config_file or one_by_one
    * new instl commands:
        ** create_readlinks, creates .readlink files instead of symlink
        ** resolve_readlinks creates symlinks instead of .readlinks file - currentlu used in copy on Mac OS
    * trans command now reads BASE_REV from config file, has new option --config
    * up2s3 command implemented using aws and writes a batch file like all other commands
    * up2s3 command can be used on a range of versions
    * * fixed bad handling of \r\n in info_map files on Windows 

    programmer visible changes:
    * new function SVNItem.walk_items_depth_first, and tests for this function
    * platformSpecificHelper_XXX new functions: rmfile, rmdir, not implemented for windows yet
    * variable BASE_REPO_REV default set to 1 for all commands
    * CONFIG_FILE variable instead to S3_CONFIG_FILE and used by all instlAdmin commands

2013-12-29  0.6.1  Shai Shasag <shai@waves.com>
    * fixed wrong depends calculation.
    * special characters in urls given to curl are now escaped using the %xx convention
