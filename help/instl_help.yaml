command:
    check-checksum:
        short: Check synced files against their expected sha1 checksum
        long: |
            Usage: instl check-checksum --in path-to-input-file [--start-progress start-progress-number] [--total-progress total-progress-number]
            check-checksum will calculate the sha1 checksum of each file listed in path-to-input-file and compare this checksum against the expected checksum listed in path-to-input-file.
            path-to-input-file should be a path to a file in info_map.txt format containing a list of the files to check. All file paths listed in path-to-input-file are relative to the current directory.
            A list of non matching or missing files is printed at the end.
            Non zero exit code is returned if any file in path-to-input-file is missing or has non matching checksum.
            check-checksum command is used in the batch created by the sync or synccopy commands and path-to-input-file would be bookkeeping/to_sync_info_map.txt.
            If --start-progress and --total-progress options are given, check-checksum will output progress messages starting with the number given in --start-progress with a total given in total-progress. Progress message for action N would be:
            Progress start-progress-number+N of total-progress;

    check-sig:
        short: Check file against it's RSA signature and expected sha1 checksum
        long: |
            Usage: instl check-sig --in file_to_check --config-file path_to_config_file [--sha1 expected_sha1_checksum] [--rsa rsa_signature]
            file_to_check is the file for which RSA signature and/or sha1 checksum will be checked.
            path_to_config_file is a YAML configuration file with relevant variables.
            If --rsa option is given, check-sig will verify the signature agains the file using the public key (variable: PUBLIC_KEY) supplied in the config file.
            If --sha2 option is given check-sig will calculate the file's sha1 checksum and compare the result to the given checksum.
            check-sig is a utility command, it is not needed for creating or using instl-based installer.

    copy:
      short: Copy files to their destination.
      long: |
            Usage: instl copy --in instl-config-yaml-file --out copy.sh [--run]
            instl's copy command will create a batch file containing instructions to copy files to their designated locations on disk. Said files were previously downloaded using the sync command. Definition of what to copy to which destination is taken from the instl-config-yaml-file.
            Keep in mind that copy command does not actually copy anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually install the files.

            path-to-input-file should be a path to a file in info_map.txt format containing a list of the folders to check.
            create-folders command is used in the batch created by the sync or synccopy commands and path-to-input-file would be bookkeeping/to_sync_info_map.txt.
            If --start-progress and --total-progress options are given, check-checksum will output progress messages starting with the number given in --start-progress with a total given in total-progress. Progress message for action N would be:
            Progress start-progress-number+N of total-progress;

    create-links:
        short: Maintains a folder of revision specific folders ready to be uploaded by the up2s3 command. (admin command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl create-links --config-file config_file --out create-links.sh [--run]
            For each revision of the svn repository, starting with the base revision, create-links will checkout the revision from svn to a Base folder, and copy the files to a folder named after the revision. Copying is done using hard links and hence the name of the command. In addition create-links will create info_map files describing the contents of the specific revision. A revision folder created successfully will contain a stamp file, that will cause the folder to be skipped the next time create-links is called.
            All information about the svn repository url, the location of the top level links folder, the base revision etc, is taken from the config file.
            relevant variables: REPO_NAME, SVN_REPO_URL, ROOT_LINKS_FOLDER_REPO, BASE_REPO_REV
            Keep in mind that create-links command does not actually do anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually create the links.

    create-repo-rev-file:
        short: creates a file containing basic information about a specific revision. (admin command)
        long: |
            The created file can be uploaded to s3 once the specific revision is ready for distribution, using up-repo-rev command.
            The variables in the created file are specified in REPO_REV_FILE_VARS variable.
            This command is intended to be called by the create-links command.

    create-rsa-keys:
        short: Create private and public RSA keys. (admin command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl create-rsa-keys --config-file path_to_config_file.
            Private key is written to a file named in variable PRIVATE_KEY_FILE which defaults to "$(REPO_NAME).private_key".
            Public key is written to a file named in variable PUBLIC_KEY_FILE which defaults to "$(REPO_NAME).public_key".
            Variables PRIVATE_KEY_FILE, PUBLIC_KEY_FILE, REPO_NAME are read from path_to_config_file.
            Key size is 4096. Keys are produced in PEM format.

            Keep in mind that fix-props command does not actually do anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually fix the properties. Also, running the batch file does not commit the properties changes, this should be manually done, after proper inspection, with an SVM client software.

    fix-symlinks:
        short: Replace symlinks with .symlink files. (admin command)
        long: |
            Usage:instl fix-symlinks  --config-file path_to_config_file --out path-to-output-file [--run]
            Since s3 cannot deal with symlinks, symlinks should not be committed to svn. Instead the fix-symlinks command will replace each symlinks with file with the same name and the extension .symlink. The .symlink file will contain the relative path of the symlink.
            The folder where symlinks will be fixed is specifies in STAGING_FOLDER variable in path_to_config_file.
            Keep in mind that fix-symlinks command does not actually do anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually fix the symlinks.

           Making changes to the svn repository cannot be done on the svn checkout folder directly, mainly because svn finds it difficult to handle deleted files. 
           When the staging folder (created by the svn2stage command) is ready, stage2svn can be called to create the svn command to add/delete files. Existing files that were changed will be discovered by svn itself. Before calling stage2svn it is advisable to call fix-symlinks, stage2svn will not accept new symlinks.
           Keep in mind that stage2svn command does not actually do anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually run the svn commands and then manually commit the changes to svn.

        short: Create a fresh staging folder by checking out the latest svn revision and copying the files to the staging folder. (admin command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl svn2stage --config-file config-file --out svn2stage.sh [--run]
            Making changes to the svn repository cannot be done on the svn checkout folder directly, mainly because svn finds it difficult to handle deleted files. svn2stage will checkout the latest revision to the svn folder (variable: SVN_CHECKOUT_FOLDER), and export the revision's files to the staging folder (variable: STAGING_FOLDER). Now changes to the staging folder can be made. When the staging folder is ready, stage2svn can be called to create the svn command to add/delete files
            Keep in mind that svn2stage command does not actually do anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually run the svn and copy commands.

            instl's trans command can translate between the format created by svn info command and the native instl info format. Additional input that can be given is the output of the svn proplist command. trans also has limited filtering options.
            trans command is used in the output of create-links command.

    unwtar:
        short: Combines split wtar files and uncompresses wtar files.
        long: |
            Usage: instl unwtar
            Walks the current directory recursively and looks for .wtar files. Files who's extension is in the format '*.wtar.aa' are split files and are combined to a .wtar file. If combination is successful a '.wtar.aa.done' file is created, this will prevent subsequent runs of unwtar from combining the files again.
            Files who's extension is in the format '*.wtar' are untared to their directory. If untarring is successful a '.wtar.done' file is created, this will prevent subsequent runs of unwtar from untarring the files again.
            unwtar command is used in the batch file created by the sync or synccopy commands.
